## CFG-Degree Team 7 Final Project
Welcome to SmartLeave!
### About the project:
Ever thought about how to ensure you are making the absolute *MOST* of the annual leave you get? Well, think no more! Let us introduce to you: ***SmartLeave.***

By entering your details you are able to store information about how many annual leave days you have been given and then also how many days you have remaining.
Then, with this application, you are able to pick one of the following options:
<ul>
<li>Find out the when the next bank holiday is</li>
<li>Know when the close together bank holidays are</li>
<li>Get help maximizing your annual leave for your next holiday</li>
<li>Prevent burnout by knowing which season has the least bank holidays</li>
<li>Find out if your birthday is on a bank holiday or weekend this year</li>
<li>Let fate decide when you should book your leave!</li> 
</ul>
